# 🍰 Home Bakery Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a simple, functional web application built for a home-based bakery business. Our goal is to create a warm and welcoming online space where customers can browse baked goods and place basic orders. The landing page features the bakery name and a custom logo designed by our team, reflecting the creativity and charm of a small business.

This first release focuses on core functionality and user experience, using a clean layout and interactive elements. Customers can submit orders via a form and view all existing orders in a dynamic dashboard table.
