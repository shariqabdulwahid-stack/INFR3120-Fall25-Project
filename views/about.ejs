        <p class="about-bio">
          Hi! My name is <strong>Isabela</strong>, and I’m the baker behind Beliciousweets.
          What started as a small hobby between school assignments slowly grew into a passion that
          lets me combine creativity, design, and food. I love experimenting with flavours, decorating
          cakes, and creating treats that brighten someone's day,  whether it's for a birthday, an event,
          or just a craving.
        </p>
        <p class="about-bio">
          When I’m not baking, I’m usually working on school projects, designing websites, or running
          my small business pop-ups. Beliciousweets is more than a bakery, it's a little piece of me
          that I get to share with others.
