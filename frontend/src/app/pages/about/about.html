        <p>
          Hi! My name is <strong>Isabela</strong>, and I’m the baker behind Beliciousweets.
          What started as a small hobby between school assignments slowly grew into a passion...
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not baking, I’m usually working on school projects, designing websites,
          or running my small business pop-ups. Beliciousweets is a little piece of me
          that I get to share with others.
